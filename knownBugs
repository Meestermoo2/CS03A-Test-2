- cannot directly output the addition of 2 complex numbers. output only shows a mixed number
e.g (cout << c+d << endl)
- need to getline in insertion or mixedNum?
- error out when taking unecessary input (21 3/4 4)
- error handlging (3-2 evaluates to 3-2i), (3+3)
- 3 4/5 + 4i should result in error
- need to scrap bad input
- magnitude evaluates to integer
- formatting
- wexit with nothing after causes to save a name with the last input
= throw an error if input goes outside data storage size
= throw if unknown command is entered
- let ?, fucking throw an error

//Features to add
- letting one variable equal another
